## Introduction
This package, Mongoosejs-cli, is a package for nodejs to help generate and run migrations and seeders for mongoosejs with ease.

>Note that this is an unofficial CLI package for [mongoosejs](https://github.com/Automattic/mongoose).

## Prerequisitesüî®

- node >=11.0.0
- yarn >= 1.16.0 || npm >= 6.0.0
- mongoosejs >= 5.5.12

## Installationüõ†

### Globally
There are two ways to of installing and using this package:

```sh
yarn global add mongoosejs-cli
```

> - Usage
>   - mongoose

### Locally

```sh
yarn add mongoosejs-cli
```

> - Usage
>   - npx mongoosejs-cli

### Note üìì
It is recommended to install the package in your project(local). We'll be using the local approach in the following examples.


## Usage

Make sure you have mongoose already installed in your project before proceeding.

### To display list of options that the command has, do the following

```sh
npx mongoosejs-cli
```
You'll see the following on your terminal:

```

### To initialize the project

We recommend that after viewing the list of commands, first thing to do, is to generate the required files and directories needed to get started. It can achieved by entering the following command.

```sh
npx mongoosejs-cli init
```

This will generate the following:

```sh
 config/
  config.json
 models/
  index.js
 migrations/
 seeders/
```


- config/ => the directory containing all your configuration files
  -  config.json => the default configuration files that contains the database connection strings based on the environment(NODE_ENV). You can add extra environments as well.
- models/ => the directory that contains all your mongoose models you generated through the package
  -  index.js => this file does the database connection and imports all your models
- migrations/ => directory containing all your migration files
- seeders/ => directory containing all your seed files

## Options

### Changing path

By default, mongoosejs-cli generates the migrations, seeders and models directories and files in the root directory of your project. To change this behaviour, create a new file called `.mongooserc` manually or use the the following command:

```sh
touch .mongooserc
```

and paste the following code inside the new created file

```js
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  'config': path.resolve('config', 'database.json'),
  'models-path': path.resolve('db', 'models'),
  'seeders-path': path.resolve('db', 'seeders'),
  'migrations-path': path.resolve('db', 'migrations')
}
```

Now the CLI will look for its
- configuration settings inside ./config/database.json
- models files inside ./db/models/
- migration files inside ./db/migrations/
- seed files inside ./db/seeders/

### Configuration file

By default the CLI will try to use the file `config/config.js`. You can modify that path either via the `--config` flag or via the option mentioned earlier. Here is how a configuration file might look like (this is the one that `npx mongoosejs-cli init` generates):

```json
{
  "development": {
    "database": {
      "url": "mongodb://localhost/mongoose_dev",
      "options": {
        "useNewUrlParser": true
      }
    }
  },
  "test": {
    "database": {
      "url": "mongodb://localhost/mongoose_test",
      "options": {
        "useNewUrlParser": true
      }
    }
  },
  "production": {
    "database": {
      "protocol": "mongodb",
      "username": "root",
      "password": "password",
      "name": "database_production",
      "host": "localhost",
      "port": "",
      "options": {
        "useNewUrlParser": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```


### Configuration for connecting over SRV

In case you are using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) or any other services that supports srv, kindly remove database name known as `"name"` from the database main object and assign its value to a new string called `"dbName"` in the options object, such as the following.

```json
{

  "production": {
    "database": {
      "protocol": "mongodb+srv",
      "username": "root",
      "password": "password",
      "host": "subdomain.mongodb.com",
      "port": "",
      "options": {
        "useNewUrlParser": true,
        "dbName": "database_production",
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In case you want to use a url string instead, do the following

```json
{

  "production": {
    "database": {
      "url": "mongodb+srv://root:password@subdomain.mongodb.com/database_production",
      "options": {
        "useNewUrlParser": true,
        "dbName": "database_production",
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Fixing Bugs or Implementing Features

1. Preparing your environment

Start by cloning Mongoosejs CLI repo

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:waptik/mongoose-cli.git

$ git clone https://github.com/waptik/mongoose-cli.git # Using HTTPS
```

Make sure you have all required dependencies, you will need

- Node v10 or above
- Yarn v1.16 or above

Now go to cloned repository folder

```sh
$ cd /path/to/cloned/repository

## FAQ
The Mongoosejs Command Line Interface (CLI) Frequently Asked Question

### Initialize mongoose to create necessary files in the project
```
$ npx mongoosejs-cli init
```

### How can I generate a model?
Specify model name with `--name` argument. List of table fields can be passed with `--attributes` option. Note that the datatypes are using [Mongoose SchemaTypes](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/schematypes.html) when defining them using the CLI.
```
$ npx mongoosejs-cli model:create --name User --attributes name:String,state:Boolean,birth:Date,card:Number
```

You can create your own custom datatypes as plugins after the model file has been generated for you. Refer to [Mongoose Plugins](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/plugins.html), on how to do so.

### How can I create a migration?
Specify migration name with `--name` argument
```
$ npx mongoosejs-cli migration:create --name <migration_name>
```

### How do call/use a model defined?
You can call/use a model(eg: Player) by doing the following:
```js
const models = require('path_to_models_folder');

const players = await models.Player.find({});

console.log(players) // will print players collection
```

### What is the command to execute all migrations?
```
$ npx mongoosejs-cli db:migrate
```
### How can I make a migrations rollback?
```
$ npx mongoosejs-cli db:migrate:undo:all
```

### How can I create a seeder?
Specify seeder name with `--name` argument
```
$ npx mongoosejs-cli seed:create --name <seeder_name>
```

### How can I run the seeders?
```
$ npx mongoosejs-cli db:seed:all
```

### How can I make the seeders rollback?
```
$ npx mongoosejs-cli db:seed:undo:all
```
